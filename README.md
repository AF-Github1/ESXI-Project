While Windows is booting up there will be a screen prompting a random key press in order to load the OS from disk. If this is not done on time the boot will fail and you will need to restart and try it again.

OS used during installation: Windows 10 Pro

After the machines are fully installed check their settings to make sure the CD drive is connected. If not, check the box

# LINUX RTR TO DMZ CERTIFICATE TRANSFERS / APACHE2 SETUP


If you havenâ€™t already take care of installing/enabling apache in the DMZ

apt install apache2
a2ensite default-ssl.conf 
a2enmod ssl
systemctl restart apache2
systemctl status apache2

In the router:
```
scp www.enta.pt.crt debian@172.31.0.100:/home
scp www.enta.pt.key debian@172.31.0.100:/home
scp /etc/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt debian@172.31.0.100:/home
```

Doesnâ€™t particularly matter where you send it, as long as you have permissions to do so. In my case I just send it directly to /home

In the DMZ:
```
cp /home/www.enta.pt.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
cp /home/www.enta.pt.key /etc/ssl/private/
cp /home/ca.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
```

In the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf file change the following section to point to the location of your transferred certificate and key.
```
                SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/www.enta.pt.crt
                SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/www.enta.pt.key
```
restart apache2 after changing the file

**systemctl restart apache2**


Now as long as I am in the same network, outside machines should be able to connect to the site using the IP 192.168.15.174 and the inside windows machine should be able to do so with the IP 172.31.0.100 



# LINUX RTR Email configuration (Dovecot, exim4)

If not installed already, install these now

**WINDOWS INSIDE Thunderbird**

The service used for the Windows Inside machine was Thunderbird

Install thunderbird

https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/

After the installation you should be presented with this screen. Go to the Home tab.

![image13](https://github.com/AF-Github1/ESXI-Project/assets/133685290/5b69094a-172b-45cc-9032-a46465942970)

Go to account settings

![image8](https://github.com/AF-Github1/ESXI-Project/assets/133685290/747d7a4b-59a5-4217-bd29-4bbb35c3a447)

You will now need to add the information relative to the SMTP Servers

![image15](https://github.com/AF-Github1/ESXI-Project/assets/133685290/7e9522e1-3821-4e74-9c0c-4a6113c89635)

You must add 3 different instances, which will have different ports and usernames


![image14](https://github.com/AF-Github1/ESXI-Project/assets/133685290/782c0583-34a1-4884-8248-113c3d8a2fcc)

![image11](https://github.com/AF-Github1/ESXI-Project/assets/133685290/fcf82cb9-7ec3-4686-ae8c-e3ecfad39527)

Go back to the home tab and click the email icon. You will be presented with a new screen. Fill it up with your credentials. It should be able to detect the configuration in your local machine if previous steps were done correctly.
In my case I later accessed this from another location, as such itâ€™s finding a configuration in the public database


![image1](https://github.com/AF-Github1/ESXI-Project/assets/133685290/753a245a-e645-4c20-8f77-ea22d834a09b)

Press done and you should have access to your email. You can test it out by trying to send one to yourself. If it works, it is configured correctly.

You can try with different ports with something like this:

![Screenshot from 2023-07-14 11-48-43](https://github.com/AF-Github1/ESXI-Project/assets/133685290/cb62d3a0-a28d-4ade-941b-97a6dbd31803)


All of these should be able to work properly provided everything is configured correctly. To note that sometimes IMAP might have some conflicts for who knows what reason and not work properly even if your setup is fine. You can tell this is happening when you try to send an email and it takes a extremely long while to actually deliver, without it ever actually saying it can't deliver said email
